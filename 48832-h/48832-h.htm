<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This entertainment was prepared for a Sunday
school's Christmas Eve, and was arranged as follows: A stage,
fourteen feet square, was fitted with a "roll-up" curtain in front.
Drapery was hung at the sides and back; a Christmas tree,
filled with presents, was placed well back on the stage, and
hidden by curtains arranged to separate in the middle. In front
of these was placed "Copper Toe Shoe House." The rear view
represents the frame made of wood, in two pieces, to separate in
the middle, of the following dimensions: ten feet from toe to
heel, five feet and one half from heel to top, four feet and one
half across top, heel about twenty inches long, eight inches high.
Cover front, in two separate sections, with black cambric; for
toe, copper tinsel paper; for sole and patch, brown cambric;
for buckle, silver tinsel paper; the patch fastened only at bottom.
A curtain, of same material or color as back stage, should
be hung in rear of shank, that children standing behind may not
be seen. A settee is placed behind it, on which the children in
the dwelling stand. 1, 2, and 3 lie upon the stage, and stick
their heads out when required. The characters can pass between
the curtains at back, to their places. When the tree is disclosed,
all the characters are in front, the settee is removed, the braces
unfastened, and, at a signal, two boys run off the shoe, and
others draw the curtains.</p></div>
